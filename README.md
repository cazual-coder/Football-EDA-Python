# ⚽ Football Data Analysis Project

This project performs comprehensive data analysis on English Premier League (EPL) player statistics using Python. The dataset includes performance metrics such as goals, assists, passes, minutes played, and more — allowing for insights into player contributions, team performance, age demographics, and nationality trends.

## 📊 Project Overview

The analysis covers:

- Loading and exploring a football player dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (e.g., goals per match, minutes per match)
- Aggregation by club and nationality
- Visualization of:
  - Goal and assist distribution
  - Penalty success rate
  - Age group distributions
  - Top-performing players
  - Clubs with most/least players
  - Disciplinary records (yellow/red cards)
